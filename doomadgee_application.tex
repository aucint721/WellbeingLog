%-------------------- GREETING --------------------
Dear Selection Panel,

%-------------------- OPENING PARAGRAPH --------------------
I am writing to apply for the position of Head of Department – Student Services at Doomadgee State School for the 2026 school year. Having served in this role throughout 2025, I bring a proven record of leadership in student engagement, wellbeing, and community collaboration in a very remote context. My leadership philosophy centres on meeting students where they are, building culturally responsive partnerships, and using data to drive meaningful change.

I wish to outline my suitability for this role in response to the selection criteria.

%-------------------- CRITERION 1 --------------------
\section*{1. Demonstrated teaching competence and capacity to provide leadership leading to the achievement of quality and improved learning outcomes for all students}

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wide and varied experience across multiple curriculum areas, enabling support for students in all subject areas
    \item Skilled in tailoring teaching strategies to meet students' individual learning needs
    \item Experienced in integrating digital learning platforms to enhance engagement
\end{itemize}

At Doomadgee State School, many students required targeted support to engage with curriculum content across diverse subject areas, often complicated by limited access to digital tools. I supported students in aligning their learning with curriculum expectations by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delivering differentiated support in the Wellbeing Room, ensuring students could regulate and re-engage with classwork
    \item Introducing structured learning activities, such as chess, drafts, and Minecraft Education, to foster higher-order thinking
    \item Enabling independent laptop use so students could access online platforms confidently
    \item Collaborating with classroom teachers to align Wellbeing Room support with curriculum objectives
\end{itemize}

Resulting in students demonstrating increased confidence, improved participation, and greater resilience. This reinforced my belief in blending academic support with wellbeing strategies to ensure every student can access and succeed in the curriculum.

%-------------------- CRITERION 2 --------------------
\section*{2. Demonstrated strong interpersonal skills and the capacity to develop and sustain productive relationships within and beyond the school community}

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong interpersonal skills with the capacity to build trust across diverse cultural and community groups
    \item Skilled in sustaining productive relationships with students, families, and external agencies
    \item Experienced in culturally responsive practice through targeted professional development
\end{itemize}

In Doomadgee, a very remote Indigenous community, strong relationships were critical to engagement and wellbeing outcomes. I led these efforts by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Completing the Remote Ready Orientation program (EFI) and the Doomadgee Aboriginal Shire Council's Cross-Cultural Awareness Workshop
    \item Building trust with students through consistent presence in the Wellbeing Room
    \item Partnering with families, Elders, and external agencies to create holistic support systems
    \item Supporting staff and students with personal and career development planning
    \item Leading Wellbeing Team meetings with a focus on data-informed, culturally responsive decisions
\end{itemize}

As a result student trust increased, reflected in higher voluntary attendance in the Wellbeing Room and greater participation in academic and social activities. Staff and community collaboration strengthened, ensuring a cohesive approach to student support.

%-------------------- CRITERION 3 --------------------
\section*{3. Demonstrated capacity to use strategic thinking and analytical skills to contribute to educational outcomes at the school level}

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Skilled in collecting, analysing, and acting on student data to inform decisions
    \item Experienced in developing digital tools for real-time data access and analysis
    \item Able to use strategic thinking to target key areas for improvement
\end{itemize}

At Doomadgee State School in 2025, average student attendance was approximately 35\%, significantly below the Queensland state average of 88.1\% (2024) and the very remote community average of 65.8\%.

To address this, I:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed an iOS app to streamline data collection and analysis for the Wellbeing Team
    \item Identified behaviour and attendance trends, guiding targeted interventions
    \item Shared data insights at team meetings to refine strategies
    \item Worked with Years 7–10 sector leaders to embed data-driven approaches into behaviour management
\end{itemize}

Data-informed strategies reduced inappropriate Wellbeing Room use and increased constructive lunchtime engagement. DDA student participation rose significantly, demonstrating improved trust and acceptance. While overall attendance remains below state averages, these results highlight measurable progress against the 35\% baseline.

%-------------------- CRITERION 4 --------------------
\section*{4. Capacity to manage effectively human, financial and physical resources to deliver high quality organisational outcomes}

\textbf{Strengths:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Experienced in managing human, physical, and material resources effectively
    \item Skilled at aligning resource allocation with student wellbeing and learning goals
    \item Proven ability to plan environments that support regulation and engagement
\end{itemize}

The Wellbeing Room required transformation into a safe, engaging, and productive environment. I achieved this by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conducting a needs analysis to guide space use and resource allocation
    \item Securing and arranging new furniture to support regulation and inclusivity
    \item Mentoring Wellbeing Room staff in effective engagement strategies
    \item Introducing a new break-time support timetable for increased student access
    \item Making strategic funding decisions to maximise impact
\end{itemize}

The Wellbeing Room became a trusted hub for students, reducing negative behaviours and increasing constructive engagement. Staff confidence improved, and the room evolved into a cornerstone of wellbeing support at the school as a result.

%-------------------- CLOSING PARAGRAPH --------------------
My work at Doomadgee State School demonstrates my ability to deliver measurable outcomes in student wellbeing, engagement, and achievement despite significant contextual challenges. I am committed to continuing this work in 2026 and beyond, and I am confident my skills and experiences will add sustained value to the school community.

%-------------------- CLOSING --------------------
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can continue to contribute to the success of Doomadgee State School.
