    location: -75, 65, -75
    dialogue_options:
      - "Tell me about renewable energy"
        response: "Renewable energy includes solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. These sources are sustainable and don't deplete natural resources."
      - "How do I design a green building?"
        response: "Green buildings use energy-efficient materials, natural lighting, and sustainable construction methods. Consider insulation and solar panels."
      - "What about waste management?"
        response: "Effective waste management includes recycling, composting, and reducing consumption. Design systems to minimize waste production."

  - name: "Prof. Waters"
    location: -80, 65, -80
    dialogue_options:
      - "How can I conserve water?"
        response: "Water conservation includes rainwater harvesting, efficient irrigation, and low-flow fixtures. Design systems to capture and reuse water."
      - "What are sustainable water systems?"
        response: "Sustainable water systems include greywater recycling, rainwater collection, and efficient distribution networks."
      - "How do I test water quality?"
        response: "Water quality testing involves checking pH levels, turbidity, and chemical content. Use testing kits and monitoring systems."
